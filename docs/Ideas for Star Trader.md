SO YOU'RE NEW?
Just try to get the feel of the game. Find a friend and play for an hour or two. Spend a few days thinking about the game. Now get a few friends and play another short game for an hour or two.

Do you like the game? GREAT! Now read the box called ARE YOU GETTING INTO IT?

STARDUST SPINOFFS
What does it feel like to fly a spaceship?
How many crew members do you need? Are they men or women or mixed? What size is the ship?
Sketch or paint a model of the ship.
Is your food and water stored on board? Do you recycle it? Are there hydroponic gardens in your ship?
What do you use for fuel? How often do you need to refuel?
Do you own the ship or do all the crew members have joint ownership?
Why are there pirate ships? Can you become one? Where would you refuel?
Does your ship land on a planet or do space tugs ferry the merchandise up and down? How much does it cost? Are there space longshoremen strikes?
What about taxes?
Do you have stowaways? What does space law tell you to do with them if they are discovered between stars?
ARE YOU GETTING INTO IT?
I'll make two suggestions:

Get two or three friends who've also gotten their feet wet. If necessary, talk them into it. Start a 50 year game. If you and your friends play once a week in two hours chunks, (Friday? During the week after school?) the game will easily last a whole school year.
Don't forget - each time you stop, type SAVE as your next port of call and keep the paper tape.

Set up your own game and try different situations. You can
Play with up to 12 players.
Choose ships per player so total number of ships is less than or equal to 12.
Ask for 4 to 13 star systems to start.
Pick any length game (a million years?
Change the cargo tonnage limits of a ship.
Fiddle with the minimum interstellar distance.
Fix the maximum number of bids per round ("OUR FINAL BID ...")
Set the profit margin.
START A CLUB
Find some friends and tell them about your strategies.
Talk about their strategies.
Design a new, better Star Traders game.
There are lots of good science fiction stories. How many are about interstellar merchants? What merchandise do they sell or trade?
HERE ARE SOME IDEAS FOR A BETTER GAME
Here are some ideas for a better game -

Change the way the star are setup.
Make more than one Class I star to start with so there will be competing trade centers.
Allow a player to go pirate for awhile. But if he's caught, he _ _ _ _ _ (you fill in).
If a level III is growing too quickly, put an interstellar embargo on selling Uranium there. Otherwise, the locals would have a nuclear war.
Make up better merchandise.
How about ship-to-ship trading at certain open ports.
If ships could pick their interstellar speed, how would you design the game to make very high speeds costly? Maybe at high speeds, the chances go up that the ship will fall apart, or maybe each step in speed squares the fuel cost, or maybe ...
SO YOU'RE FINALLY AN OLD TIMER ...
You've played a dozen games with many variations. You're probably playing a long-rang game (50 years? 100 years?) with friends once or twice a week. Congratulations!

A few suggestions, some of which you've probably thought of -

Play a tight game. 2 ships per player, 1 star system per ship, 25 light year minimum interstellar distance, and push the profit margin to 5. Drop max tonnage to 25 (or even 20), allow only 2 bids per round, and Good Luck - hope you make some money!
Play an easy game. 2 players, 1 ship each, 13 stars, 15 lightyear interstellar distance, and drop the profit margin number to 1. Max tonnage make 60, allow 9 bids per round, you should make millions.
Study the program.
